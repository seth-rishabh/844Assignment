# 844Assignment

Performing explorative analysis on lung cancer dataset with 5 different algorithms to identify which one does the best job in terms of accuracy of predicition, but also other evaluation metrics like precision, F1-score, and recall.

To navigate the repository:
  - Dataset folder: where the lung cancer dataset is stored
  - models: where all 5 ML algorithm model code is stored

    note: NaiveBayes.py contains code for gausian model, however, it was used to bench mark performance compared to bernioulli model and ultimately decide which one to use for analysis

  - featureSelection: two feature selection models that use a filter based approach are stored
